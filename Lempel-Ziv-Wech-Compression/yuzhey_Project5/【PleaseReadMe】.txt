Hi, I used eclipse so I just include the src file of my project.

The compression and decompression class is in Package "compression". My own hash table and linked list class is in Package "cmu.andrew.yuzhey"

I seperated LZWCompress and LZWDecompress as two java class for seperate of concern.

All the required files could be successfully compressed and decompressed, both binary and text.

The process of comression and decompressino for words.html is about 3 seconds, for CrimeLatLonXY1990.csv takes about 5 seconds, and for 01_Overview.mp4 about 24 seconds. 

Thank you.
